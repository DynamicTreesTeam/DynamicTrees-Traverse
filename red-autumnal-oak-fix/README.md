# Red Autumnal Oak Fix
Whilst porting to 1.16, I didn't realise that the Red Autumnal Oak tree was changed
to use dark oak logs instead of oak, so the dynamic red autumnal oak is a regular oak
tree. Unfortunately, changing this back to dark oak means that all red autumnal oaks 
turn into normal oaks on existing worlds; until I find a workaround that doesn't break
any existing worlds in this way, I made a tree pack to fix it. Note that this should only
be used if you are generating new worlds or simply don't care that red autumnal oaks will 
be replaced with regular oaks. 

## Installation
- Extract <a href="./Red Autumnal Oak Fix.zip">Red Autumnal Oak Fix</a>. 
- Place enclosed `trees` folder in your root Minecraft directory. Merge with the existing folder if one already exists. 
- Place enclosed `Red Autumnal Oak Fix` folder in the `resourcepacks` directory in your root Minecraft folder. 
- Restart the game (`/reload` may also work but I haven't tested it).
- Make sure the resource pack is selected.
