# Dynamic Trees for Traverse
Dynamic Trees compatibility add-on for Traverse. This is a fork of [odorousrex's](https://github.com/odorousrex) [original project](https://github.com/odorousrex/DynamicTreesTraverse), as it no longer works with newer versions of Dynamic Trees. 

## Download
Download the old project at it's [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-trees-traverse-compat), but note it no longer works with newer versions of Dynamic Trees. The updated version will be released very soon.

## Supported Trees
- Fir
- Brown Autumnal Oak
- Orange Autumnal Oak
- Red Autumnal Oak
- Yellow Autumnal Birch
